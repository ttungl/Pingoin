# pingoin
Googlemap based android app
#### Mobile Computing and Applications: 
Pingo'in is created by using a Google maps API. You can build your list of points of interest (POI) on the Googlemap, then the application will scan your map in the preset radius, if your POIs are within this radius, they will be displayed on your screen. Used Java, Eclipse for building the app, and used SVN for merging the code project.
