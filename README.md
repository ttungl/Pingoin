Googlemap based android app
#### Mobile Computing and Applications: 
Created a Google maps android application. You can build your list of points of interest (POI) wherever you prefer in your map, the app will scan your map in preset range, if some POIs are within this range, they will be pop-up to show your saved interests in the area. Used Java, Eclipse for building the app, and used SVN for code management.
